The social media feed project is a web application that allows users to view and interact with profile cards, leave comments, and give likes to the displayed profiles.

This project utilizes React to manage the user interface and localStorage to store data locally in the browser. Additionally, it uses APIs to fetch random user data and cat images.

These components and functionalities together create a social media feed experience where users can engage with profile cards and can create and manage their own profiles.
